# Pokemon-EXP-Rate-Generator-For-ROM-Hacks-
This small tool functions as a new way for those creating their own ROM hack (any Gen) with balanced experience rates.

One of the main issues with the core games is the absolutely arbituary EXP values assigned to Pokemon. What this generator does, is take the Pokemon's Base Stat total, along with it's evolutionary stage, then calculate a new experience rate to reflect the Pokemon's strength.

This tool offers a simple and easy solution to fix the experience rates to a proper number, and offer better overall balance throughout their game.

Future updates may include a text file(s) with Pokemon default experience values already included with the tool - and the tool at this point would be for updating Pokemon whose base stats were altered. For now, I offer the tool itself as a resource.
